Project Sloth Walking Styles

A script allows players to set and save their preferred walk style, which will persist even after the server is restarted. This may seem like a small feature, but it adds an extra level of immersion and personalization. Players can choose from a variety of walk styles, ranging from casual strolls to confident strides, and have their character consistently reflect their chosen style
